# Tello Programming with Python and Raspberry Pi

This lesson will demonstrate how to run the Tello box mission from Lesson 4 on Raspberry Pi. The video tutorial for this lesson is available at:

[https://learn.droneblocks.io/p/tello-drone-programming-with-python/](https://learn.droneblocks.io/p/tello-drone-programming-with-python/)

This document walks through the steps necessary to execute Python on Pi and control Tello. We assume that you already have Raspian OS installed on your SD card. If you're not familiar with this process then check out the following tutorial:

1. Power on your Pi and let it boot into the desktop screen
2. Open a Terminal window
3. Clone the code repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/dbaldwin/DroneBlocks-Tello-Python.git`
4. Change into the lesson 4 directory: `cd DroneBlocks-Tello-Python/lesson4-box-mission`
5. Power up Tello and connect to Tello WiFi
6. Execute the mission with: `python TelloBoxMission.py`

It's as simple as that!
