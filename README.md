# Tello Programming with Python

This GitHub respository contains the Python source code for each of the lessons in our DroneBlocks course:

This online course will walk you through using Python to program your Tello drone for autonomous flight. As of 4/1/18 the commands supported by Tello are:

 - command
 - takeoff
 - land
 - up xx (fly up a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - down xx (fly down a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - left xx (fly left a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - right xx (fly right a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - forward xx (fly forward a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - back xx (fly backward a distance from 20 - 500 cm)
 - go x y z speed (fly x y z distance with speed)
 - cw xx (yaw clockwise with angle from 1 - 3600 degrees)
 - ccw xx (yaw counter clockwise with angle from 1 - 3600 degrees)
 - flip x (flip l/r/f/b/bl/br/fl/fr)
	 - l = left
	 - r = right
	 - f = forward
	 - b = backward
	 - bl = backward left
	 - br = backward right
	 - fl = forward left
	 - fr = forward right
- speed x (set speed from 1 - 100 cm/s)
- speed? (get current speed)
- battery? (get current battery percentage)
- time? (get current flight time)
